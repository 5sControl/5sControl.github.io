    <tr>
      <td class="feature">
        <h3>Ensures operations are completed correctly</h3>
        <p>Through automated checks, and real-time monitoring, it verifies that each task or operation is executed accurately and in compliance with predefined standards. By minimizing human errors and deviations, this feature promotes consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="feature">
        <h3>Detects missing operations</h3>
        <p>By comparing the actual execution of tasks against the expected sequence, Operation control alerts users to any missing steps or operations that may have been inadvertently skipped. This feature enhances operational integrity, reduces the risk of errors or oversights, ultimately contributing to improved efficiency, accuracy, and overall process effectiveness.</p>
